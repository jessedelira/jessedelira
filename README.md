## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jesse and I'm a software engineer, mostly interested in full-stack web development. I enjoy working in the Node.js ecosystem along with using TypeScript whenever possible.

I have been programming since 2018, it has been quite the journey from knowing nothing to now knowing a little more than nothing. I find working on side projects helps bring the fun back into programming, having complete control of your work is a liberating feeling. Right now I'm working on [**Gym Tracker**](https://github.com/jessedelira/gym-tracker) feel free to use/contribute!
